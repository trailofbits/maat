/// that data would be loaded into RAM.
/// Properties other than the main data and instructions of the
/// binary are not supposed to repeatedly queried through this
/// interface. This information is intended to be read from
/// this class exactly once, during initialization, and used to
/// populate the main decompiler database. This class currently
/// has only rudimentary support for accessing such properties.

/// and the processor.
